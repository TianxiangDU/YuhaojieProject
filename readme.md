## Yuhaojie Project
This readme means to record the process of the project. It's better remark everything into this repo and we can have a good communication.  
This repo contains 3 parts.  
1. The documents and articles which can be our references.
2. The codes and tools we use, and the source code of all the project.
3. The opinions and discussions we have.

We need to have a complete article before 15th Nov., or if we can not have a good result, we can finish it after that date.
